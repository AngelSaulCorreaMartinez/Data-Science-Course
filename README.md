# Data Science Practice

This repository contains various scripts and notebooks developed during my data science learning journey. Each project implements different concepts and techniques learned.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics/modules:
- **HarvardCourse/**: Implementations based on Harvard's course
  - kNN: k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
  - (More modules will be added as the course progresses)

## Purpose
This is a personal practice repository where I document my progress and experiments while learning data science. Each project includes its own documentation.
